## Prompt
write a commodore 64 GEOBASIC script that parses a markdown file and shows an formatted output

## output
Parsing a Markdown file and displaying the formatted output on a Commodore 64 using GEOBASIC can be a somewhat complex task, as GEOBASIC does not have built-in support for Markdown syntax. However, with a little bit of coding and some careful planning, it is possible to create a GEOBASIC program that can parse and display a Markdown file.

Here's an outline of the steps you might follow to create a GEOBASIC script that parses a Markdown file and displays the formatted output:

Load the Markdown file into a GEOBASIC string variable. You can do this using the "LOAD" function and the "INPUT$" function.

Split the Markdown file into individual lines. You can do this using the "SPLIT" function and a line break character as the delimiter.

Iterate through the lines of the Markdown file, applying the appropriate formatting as you go. You can use the "TextStyle" function to apply formatting such as bold, italic, or underline to the text.

Use the "PRINT" function to display the formatted text on the screen.

Here's an example of what this might look like in code:


        ' Load the Markdown file into a string variable
        markdown = LOAD("markdown.txt")

        ' Split the Markdown file into individual lines
        lines = SPLIT(markdown, CHR$(10))

        ' Iterate through the lines of the Markdown file
        FOR i = 0 TO UBOUND(lines)
          line = lines[i]

          ' Check for bold text
          IF LEFT$(line, 2) = "**" AND RIGHT$(line, 2) = "**" THEN
            ' Extract the bold text
            boldText = MID$(line, 3, LEN(line) - 4)
            ' Display the bold text in bold
            PRINT USING "TextStyle(BOLD)"; boldText
          END IF

          ' Check for italic text
          IF LEFT$(line, 1) = "*" AND RIGHT$(line, 1) = "*" THEN
            ' Extract the italic text
            italicText = MID$(line, 2, LEN(line) - 2)
            ' Display the italic text in italic
            PRINT USING "TextStyle(ITALIC)"; italicText
          END IF

          ' ...and so on, checking for other Markdown syntax and applying the appropriate formatting
  
This is just a basic example of how you might parse and display a Markdown file in GEOBASIC. You may need to add additional code to handle other types of Markdown syntax, such as headers, lists, and links.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
